# Forth PY

A Forth parser written in Python 3.5

__Note from the future:__ I regret not giving credit to the origin of this code. I wrote this project as a learning experience for python and parsing. Looking back (from March 2020), I'm 95% sure that I based this code on the javascript code of [skilldrick](https://github.com/skilldrick). This code can be found at https://skilldrick.github.io/easyforth/

## Usage

``` bash
$ python main.py
> : foo ." Hello World" ;
 ok
> foo
Hello World ok
> 
```
